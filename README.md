# 📘 Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project predicts the probability of admission for students applying to universities based on their academic profiles.
The model uses the popular Admission_Predict.csv dataset and performs:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Visualization

Model Selection using GridSearchCV

Cross-validation

Model Training (Linear Regression)

Prediction for new student profiles

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### The project includes:
```
Histogram distribution of all major features
Checking missing values
Dataset structure & information
Statistical description
```
EDA helps understand feature patterns and data distribution before model building.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Removed Serial No. column

- Replaced zeros in:
```
['GRE', 'TOEFL', 'University Rating', 'SOP', 'LOR', 'CGPA']
with NaN values
```

- Created a clean copy of the dataset for modeling

## 📦 Model Building
### ✔ Splitting Data
- Features (X): All independent variables
- Target (y): Probability of Admission
- Train-test split: 80% train, 20% test

### ✔ Model Selection with GridSearchCV
### Tested models:
- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Support Vector Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- KNN Regressor

### ✔ Evaluation
Linear Regression performed the best with the highest accuracy.

## 🧪 Model Training
- Trained LinearRegression() model
- Achieved high test accuracy
- Final predictions made using the trained model

---
## 🧮 Example Predictions
```
model.predict([[337, 118, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 9.65, 0]])
model.predict([[320, 113, 2, 2.0, 2.5, 8.64, 1]])
```
Output is displayed in percentage probability of admission.
